# Stomata_Aperture_Measurement_2017
This repository contains code written in Matlab to, 
1. Detect stomata
2. Measure aperture of detected stomata, 
for a given set of microscope images of vine leaves.

This work is published in the Journal of Plant Methods. The paper can be accessed at: https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-017-0244-9

Tested on Matlab 2016b and higher versions.

# File Description

- Main file: VWS_StomataDetection_COD_Skeletanized.m
- Function files: 
  1. getROIinRange.m - extracts regions of interest which contain stomata
  2. getSkeletanizedAperture.m	- applies a skeletanization method to measure the pore opening of the stomata
  3. getStomataOpening.m - applies a segmentation based technique to measure the pore opening of the stomata
  4. fit_ellipse.m	- fit an ellipse to a line segment (Copyright to: Ohad Gul)

- Pre-trained Cascade Object Detector to test the code: stomateDetector_v0.xml (to avoid training, set training=false)
- A sample Matlab labeling Session containing ground truths: Test.mat (to enable training, set training=true)

# Parameter tuning

Several parameters need to be tuned to achieve best possible result for a given dataset.
